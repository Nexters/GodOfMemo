Mind Paper
============================================================================

This android application helps you organize your notes, memos and thoughts.

Are you the person who puts stuff in certain places that only you can remember but everyone else thinks you are messy?
Do you work better with images?
Do you remember things better by their locations?
Are you a visual person?

If you say yes on any of the four questions, then this app is for you. In this app, you are given a large blank paper where you can add notes and move them around to where you want and can remember. In addition, this app lets you group the notes together so that you can organize your ideas and thoughts more effectively. Mind Paper provides a useful tool to write, remember and work with your thoughts better.

Our goal was to create a place where people can freely write and position notes, and to bring out the “paper” in their mind in order to let them organize their thoughts visually.
